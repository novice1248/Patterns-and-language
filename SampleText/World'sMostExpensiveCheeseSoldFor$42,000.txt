Do you like blue cheese? Not everybody does. For some, the strong taste and smell, and the fact that it's made with mold, are off-putting. But other people love it!

Now a Spanish blue cheese has become the world's most expensive cheese sold at auction, after it was sold for over $42,000.

It's a type of cheese called Cabrales, which is made in Spain's northern Asturias region, and named after the town of Cabrales. The $42,000 cheese weighed a little over 2 kilograms and was made by the Ángel Díaz Herrero cheese factory.

Made from cow's milk, it was aged for 10 months in a cave in the mountains of Asturias at 1,500 meters above sea level. The temperature and humidity of the cave help mold grow, giving the cheese its special blue-green colors and spicy taste.

The auction was held by the Regulatory Council DOP Cabrales after a competition in Cabrales in which judges tasted cheeses produced by 15 different cheese factories. This was the competition's 52nd year.

After the Ángel Díaz Herrero cheese took first place in that competition, the auction began at a starting price of about $3,500. Nine different businesses competed to buy the cheese and 40 bids were placed.

The auction was won by El Llagar de Colloto, a restaurant in Oviedo, the capital of Asturias. The restaurant has now won this auction for each of the last five years.

This is also the third time for the Regulatory Council DOP Cabrales to break the record for the world's most expensive cheese.
