A high school teacher and a student's parent have been arrested in South Korea after they allegedly broke into a school at night intending to steal exam papers.

The teacher and the student's mother are believed to have broken into a girls' high school in Andong, a city southeast of Seoul, at 1:20 a.m. on July 4. The 31-year-old teacher, who had previously worked at the school, was able to enter by pressing her fingerprint on the entrance machine.

However, when they entered the teachers' office where exam papers were stored, an alarm went off and they ran away.

Police later arrested the teacher and the mother, along with a school facilities manager who is believed to have helped them by leaving the door to the teachers' office unlocked.

Investigators say the 48-year-old mother had been paying the teacher to privately tutor her daughter — which teachers at South Korean schools are not allowed to do — and they believe the mother was also paying the teacher for stolen exam papers.

Investigators believe the teacher may have stolen exam papers several times in the past. Although the teacher left the school in February of last year, the police have found that she entered the school at night several times since then, usually during exam periods.

The school facilities manager is also believed to have helped the teacher by deleting the school's CCTV footage.

Media reports say the daughter had maintained top grades, usually coming first in her school.

However, the school has now expelled her and given her a score of zero for all of her past exams.

South Korea is known for the high pressure students experience in its education system, with the results of university entrance exams especially deciding not only what university a student goes to, but the entire course of their future career.
