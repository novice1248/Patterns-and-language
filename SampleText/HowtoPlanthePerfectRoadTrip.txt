How to Plan the Perfect Road Trip
完璧なロードトリップの計画を立てるには
Road trips allow you to see a lot more than people traveling by plane or train, but they also require a lot more planning.

Here are three pieces of advice for planning the perfect road trip.

Decide on a route
Plan a route by looking at a map or searching online for interesting places to visit. It's also a great idea to talk to friends or family who have been to an area before to help you decide what places are worth visiting.

Check how long it takes to drive between each place you want to see, and make sure it's not too far. You should aim to drive for no more than seven hours a day, although less is even better. Driving for more than 10 hours without stopping can be dangerous due to tiredness.

Plan where you'll stay
Whether you choose to stay in hotels or rent a camper on your trip, it's best to plan where you'll sleep each night so you know where you need to drive to each day.

If you're on a budget, book your accommodation about three or four weeks before your trip, when it's often cheaper.

Allow extra time
Just because you have a plan doesn't mean you have to stick to it. Give yourself extra time on your trip so you can stop if you drive past something that looks interesting. You can also take a detour to somewhere that isn't on your route, or take a route that's longer but has better scenery.
