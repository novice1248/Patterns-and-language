Regular Coca-Cola in the US could soon be sweetened with cane sugar instead of high-fructose corn syrup, according to US President Donald Trump.

On July 16, Trump said Coca-Cola had agreed to switch to using cane sugar for its US Coke. This is used to sweeten the drink in Mexico, and some fans say it tastes better.

Writing on his own social media platform, Trump said: "I'd like to thank all of those in authority at Coca-Cola. This will be a very good move by them — You'll see. It's just better!"

However, Coca-Cola didn't confirm that it had agreed to make the change. The company then defended its use of high-fructose corn syrup, which US Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy has previously said he wants to ban.

But the debate over which sugar is better forgets an important fact: people are increasingly looking for Coke with no sugar at all.

Coca-Cola Zero Sugar, which was introduced in 2017, uses both the artificial sweetener aspartame and the natural sweetener stevia in its recipe.

It's one of Coke's fastest-growing products.

PepsiCo has also noted that 60% of its sales volumes in its largest markets in the second quarter came from low- or no-sugar drinks.

And experts are doubtful that Coca-Cola will fully move away from high-fructose corn syrup, which has sweetened Coke in the US since the 1980s.

Duane Stanford, from Beverage Digest said there would be supply chain issues and the US doesn't make enough cane sugar for Coke's needs.

The corn industry wasn't happy with Trump's comments either. Corn Refiners Association President and CEO John Bode said replacing high-fructose corn syrup with cane sugar makes no sense and would cost thousands of American manufacturing jobs.

Kennedy blames corn syrup — and other sugars — for the country's obesity problems. "Sugar is poison, and Americans need to know that," he has said.
